# FCC-Salon-Appointment-Scheduler
This repository explores the languages SQL and Bash as a part of freeCodeCamp's Relational Database Certification. In this context I have used them to create a salon appointment scheduler. In the salon.sql file you will find the salon database along with its relevant tables. The salon.sh file prompts the user for their information, inserting it into the database.
